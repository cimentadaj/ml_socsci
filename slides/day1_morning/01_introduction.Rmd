That sounds somewhat familiar to social scientists `r emo::ji("thinking")`

- Perhaps our goal is not to **predict** it but it is certainly to **learn** it and **understand** it

Here comes the catch:

# Prediction vs Inference

- Social Scientists are concerned with making inferences about their data

# Difference in workflow

- Machine Learning practioners have renamed stuff statisticians have been doing for 100 years

--

 * Features --> Variables
 * Feature Engineering --> Creating Variables
 * Supervised Learning --> Models that have a dependent variable
 * Unsupervised Learning --> Models that don't have a dependent variable

> I won't discuss the first two approaches, since we have a lot of experience with that. Throughout the course we'll show main models they use for prediction.

--

- Machine Learning practioners have developed extra steps to make sure we don't overfit the data

--

 * Training/Testing data --> Unknown to us
 * Cross-validation --> Unknown to us
 * Loss functions --> Model fit --> Known to us but are not predominant (RMSE, $R^2$ etc...)

> These are very useful concepts. Let's focus on those.

- In the first prediction, this is better because **testing** is "pristine"
- However, if we repeat the train/testing iteration 2, 3, 4, ... times, we'll start to
  learn the **testing** data too well (**overfitting**)!

- I know what you're thinking... we'll also overfit on these 10 slots if we repeat this 2, 3, 4, ... times.
- That's why I said: **it's the least bad approach**

> So yes, the model fitted on the training data (in any way, be it the whole data or through cross-validation), will always have a lower error than the training set.

# Loss functions

> As I told you, machine learning practitioners like to put new names to things that already exist. 

Loss functions are metrics that evaluate your model fit:
* $R^2$
* AIC
* BIC
* RMSE
* etc...

These are familiar to us!

---
# Loss functions

However, they work with several others that are specific to prediction:

* Confusion matrix
* Accuracy
* Precision
* Specificity
* etc...

These are the topic of the next class!

# A unified example

Let's combine all the new steps into a complete pipeline of machine learning. Let's say we have the age of a person and their income and we want to predict their income based on the age. The data looks like:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tmp_age_inc <- age_inc
age_inc$age <- round(age_inc$age)
age_inc$income <- round(age_inc$income)
DT::datatable(head(age_inc))
```

---
# A unified example

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height = "90%", dpi = 300}
library(tidyverse)

age_inc %>%
  ggplot(aes(age, income)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_linedraw()
```

---

# A unified example

Let's partition our data into training and testing:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(rsample)

set.seed(213151)
split_age_inc <- initial_split(age_inc)
train_df <- training(split_age_inc)
test_df <- testing(split_age_inc)
```

<br>

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE}

DT::datatable(train_df, caption = "Training",
              options = list(paging = TRUE,
                             pageLength =  5,
                             bLengthChange = FALSE)
              )

```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE}

DT::datatable(test_df, caption = "Testing",
              options = list(paging = TRUE,
                             pageLength =  5,
                             bLengthChange = FALSE)
              )

```
]

---

# A unified example

Run a simple regression `income ~ age` on the **training** data and plot predicted values:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height = "80%", dpi = 300}
library(yardstick)

mod1 <- lm(income ~ age, data = train_df)

pred_vals <- function(mod, trn_df) {
  pred_df <-
    bind_cols(
      trn_df,
      pred_income = predict(mod, newdata = trn_df)
    )
  
  pred_df
}

pred_df <- pred_vals(mod1, train_df)
rmse_pred <- rmse_vec(pred_df$income, pred_df$pred_income)

pred_income <- function(mod, trn_df) {

  pred_df <- pred_vals(mod, trn_df)
  
  train_df %>%
    ggplot(aes(age, income)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line(data = pred_df, aes(y = pred_income), color = "red") +
    scale_x_continuous(name = "Age") +
    scale_y_continuous(name = "Income",
                       label = dollar_format(suffix = "€", prefix = "")) +
    theme_linedraw()
}

pred_income(mod1, train_df)
```

---

# A unified example

It seems we're underfitting the relationship. To measure the **fit** of the model, we'll use the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Remember it?

$$ RMSE = \sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^n{\frac{(\hat{y} - y)^2}{N}}} $$

The current $RMSE$ of our model is `r round(rmse_pred, 2)`. This means that on average our predictions are off by around `r round(rmse_pred, 2)` euros.

---

# A unified example

- How do we increase the fit? 

<br>

- It seems that the relationship is non-linear, so we would need to add non-linear terms to the model ($age^2$, $age^3$, ..., $age^10$, for example). 

<br>

- However, remember, by fitting these non-linear terms repetitevely to the data, we might tweak the model to **learn** the data so much that it starts to capture noise rather than the signal. 

<br>

- This is where cross-validation comes in!

# A unified example

We can run the model on the entire **training** data with 3 non-linear terms and check the fit:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height = "80%", dpi = 300}
mod1 <- lm(income ~ poly(age, 3), data = train_df)

pred_df <- pred_vals(mod1, train_df)
rmse_pred <- round(rmse_vec(pred_df$income, pred_df$pred_income), 2)

pred_income(mod1, train_df)
```

The $RMSE$ on the training data for the three polynomial model is `r rmse_pred`.

---
# A unified example

Finally, once our model final model has been fit and we're finished, we use the fitted model to predict on the **testing** data:

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height = "70%"}
rmse_pred2 <- round(rmse_vec(test_df$income, predict(mod1, newdata = test_df)), 2)

pred_income(mod1, test_df)
```
]

* Training RMSE is `r rmse_pred`
* Testing RMSE is `r rmse_pred2`

Testing RMSE will almost always be higher, since we always overfit the data in some way through cross-validation.
